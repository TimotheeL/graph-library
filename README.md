# Graph Library

Linked lists and Graph library implementation in C.
University project developed by Thibault BERTIN and Timothée LAURENT as part of the Graph Theory course (1st year of Master's degree) at the Université de Franche-Comté.

## Usage

To use this project, place yourself in the root directory of the project (where this README should normally be located) and open a terminal. To build the project, type the command `make`. To launch the project, type`./BIN/main`.

Alternatively, we created a very basic shell script to build and launch the project. You can use it by typing `./build.sh`. You will however need to type the command `chmod +x build.sh` before using it for the first time.
